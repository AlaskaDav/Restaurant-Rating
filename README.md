### PROJECTS

 AIRLINE FLIGHT DELAYS

### Project Description

 This Record contains 5,000,000+ commercial airline flights in 2015, compiled for the U.S. DOT Air Travel Consumer Report. Each record represents a single flight, including the airline name, flight number, origin/destination airport and flight distance, as well as scheduled/actual departure and arrival times

#### Data Source

Airline FLight Data : The data sets used for the analysis includes; 
- flights.csv: containing the number of flights in the country
- airline.csv: contains the number of different airline
- airports.csv: this file contains different e=airports and locatio within the country
- cancellation_code.csv: contains the number of cancellation that occured within the perios of analysis.

#### Tools Used 

- Microsoft Excel: for easy access the contents of the file and understanding of the components of the data.
    - [Download here](http://microsoft.com)
- Powerquerry : To carry ETL process on the data
- PowerBI: For visualization and creating reports

#### ETL Processing

In the initial data preparation process, the following process was performed
1. Data Extraction: extracting data files (.csv files) from Microsoft Excel into Powerquerry for cleaning and transformation
2. Transformation process taken place involves:
   - Removing duplicate values
   - Removing null Values from the data
   - Changing data types
   - Removing empty rows and columns
   - Creating  new columns
3. Loading process involves loading the completely transformed and cleaned data into PowerBI to build dashboard for reporting and visualizations.
 
#### Recommended Analysis

1. How does the overall flight volume vary by month? By day of week? 

#### Data Analysis Procedures:

- Collected data through .csv files from MsExcel.
- Uploading the data into PowerQuery for Cleaning and analysing the contents of the data
- Requested for data clarification and data validity.
- Loaded the data into PowerBi for visualization and Presentation.
- Providing insights, presenting informations and advice.
- Creating outstanding reports for end user understanding, board of directors and shareholders.

#### Results and Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows;
1. The total number of On-Time flights recorded during the period was 3.69millio(63.47%) while the delayed flight records 2.13million and Flight cancelled record was 89.88k

#### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:
 - Improvement of airport infrastructure and managements
 - Ensure the reliability of on-Time departure with good experience
 - Implementing new technologies to optimize airport operations
 - Improving the level of communication between airlines and airport operations 

#### Limitations

There was a difficulty in representing the insight from the data in periods, so, I had to create a Date table independently from the data and then built a relationship in the model table so as to present the report in a well organized periodic manner i.e Month reporting and Dayl)
